***osu!jukebox is a music player for your osu! library!***
It's based on Electron to ensure multiplat functionallity.

**v0.2 Notes:** 
1. Implemented Howler.JS instead of regular HTML5 Audio player
2. The song name/artist are now pulled from .osu files themselves
3. Added search, so you can search through the scanned music!
4. Revamped audio controls; Previous and next track buttons added.

**NEXT UP:**
    1. More playback features? 
    2. Bug hunting/optimisation??


**Give it a go and let me know how it does / feel free to contribute!! :):)**

Old notes:

*v0.1 Notes:
There may be some lingering bugs, but the core functionallity should be working well enough! ... and I'm going to bed :-)*
Electron Developer menu can be accessed with: *set NODE_ENV=development* 
    NEXT UP:
    1. Pulling proper metadata from maps (currently going off of MP3 metadata)
    2. Implementing Howler.JS
