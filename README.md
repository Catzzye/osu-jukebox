***osu!jukebox is a music player for your osu! library!***
It's based on Electron to ensure multiplat functionallity.


*v0.1 Notes:
There may be some lingering bugs, but the core functionallity should be working well enough! ... and I'm going to bed :-)*


**NEXT UP:**
1. Pulling proper metadata from maps (currently going off of MP3 metadata)
2. Implementing Howler.JS

**Give it a go and let me know how it does / feel free to contribute!! :):)**
